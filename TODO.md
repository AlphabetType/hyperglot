# TODO

## Code

- [ ] Check Tundra Enets (enh) - was missing validity and marked as 'weak' now
- [ ] `numerals` attribute unused so far (we talked about a `0123456789` default) — should the default for be script-dependent? Do we actually want to fail fonts without numerals?

Ask externists to check:

- [ ] Hebrew & Yiddish

Later:

- [ ] languages with some speakers should never be marked extinct
